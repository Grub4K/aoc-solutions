## How to use
Put your input files into `<year>/input/<day>.txt` whereas `day` is padded to 2 places,
so the input for day 1 for aoc 2021 would be `2021/input/01.txt`

Enter the `<year>/<language>` folder and execute the script for the respective day.
It should output 2 lines, one for the first part and one for the second
